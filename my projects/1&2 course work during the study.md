<summary>Conclusion and project improvements recommendations</summary>
  
New function (private events in the schedule) is ready to be released. Several adjustments as required as per bug report above. In general, this bug is not a blocking one, so its correction after the product release is acceptable.

## Recommendation

It is crucial to allow creation of the events more than a month in the past by clicking on the “+” button. For details please follow attached bug report https://alex-qa-bug-report.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/DH1/issues
